The `Keyboard` class has an `__init__` method to initialize two attributes: `language` and `connection`. It also has two methods, `defination` (which states the keyboard is an input device) and `number_of_keys` (which states there are 101 keys). The `my_keyboard` object is created with 'English' as the language and 'wireless' as the connection.

The `AboutMe` class represents a person with attributes `name`, `address`, and `occupation`. The `talk()` method introduces the person using these details. The `Shanto` object is created, and calling `Shanto.talk()` prints a brief introduction.
